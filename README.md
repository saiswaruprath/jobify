#JOBIFY

###A full-stack application that will be highly useful for job searchers in the hunt for jobs and make their lives easier in helping to keep track of thousands of applications easily. Jobify is a MERN stack application and deployed on Render. 

###It is primarily targeted to help students and job seekers who are always in the search of their next opportunity and hence apply to thousands of jobs and often lose track of which ones they need to focus for interviews and which ones to ignore post rejection, due to the thousands of emails they receive for the status updates. Using our application, an user can immediately login and update the status of an application which saves them lot of time instead of going through each and every email in detail and keeping track of all their job applications.

### Firstly, the user can login if they already have created an account or else click on register and create an account with name, email and password.

### Once the user logs in, they get four major options to select from the dashboard which is stats, all jobs, add job and profile. In the profile page the user can go and change details based on their preferences and save them. 

###Using add job page, the user can add details of a job application that they want to keep track of from the list of jobs they have applied. 

###Once they click on all jobs, a list of jobs comes up under their name and also they have the option to filter any job that they want to look at using  search, job status, job type, sort them(latest, oldest, a-z etc.) Once they get the job they want, they can edit the status or any other thing they want to for their application. All the jobs are presented from latest to old.

### Next comes the stats page which consists of all the job applications that a user has based on pending status, interviews scheduled and applications declined. There is also the added feature of providing details of how many monthly applications a user has applied and they can view the details either as a bar chart or area chart.
